# Final Status Summary - SemEval 2026 Task 2

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Status**: ✅ **SUBMISSION COMPLETE & CONFIRMED**

---

## ✅ Final Confirmation from Organizers

**Date**: 2026-01-14, 10:10 PM
**From**: Nikita Soni (Organizer)

> "Yes, all of that sounds correct!"
>
> "The initial note is only to let you know that **If you are using any text data, then you are allowed to use only the training text data** for subtasks 2a and 2b."

**Interpretation**:
- ✅ Our submission file is correct (46 users, correct format)
- ✅ We can use training text data for modeling
- ✅ No issues with our predictions

## 📊 Submission Status

### Subtask 2a - State Change Forecasting

**File**: `results/subtask2a/pred_subtask2a.csv`

**Submission Details**:
- ✅ **Submitted to CodaBench**: YES (already submitted)
- ✅ **Format validated**: 46 user-level predictions
- ✅ **Organizer confirmed**: Correct
- ✅ **Deadline**: January 25, 2026

**Validation Results**:
```
✅ 46 predictions (correct count)
✅ Correct format: user_id,pred_state_change_valence,pred_state_change_arousal
✅ All 46 users with is_forecasting_user==True included
✅ No NaN values
✅ No duplicates
```

**Model Performance** (validation):
- CCC Average: 0.6833
- Valence CCC: ~0.76
- Arousal CCC: ~0.61
- Ensemble: seed777 (50.16%) + arousal_specialist (49.84%)

## 🎯 What We Did Right

1. ✅ **Submission file**: Already had correct format (46 users)
2. ✅ **Model training**: Used training text data appropriately
3. ✅ **Ensemble approach**: 2-model ensemble optimized
4. ✅ **Clarification**: Asked organizers when uncertain

---

## ⚠️ Initial Confusion (Resolved)

### What Caused the Confusion:

**Organizer's initial email**:
> "Subtask 2a and 2b are forecasting tasks so **no (future) texts can be used** for forecasting state_change"

**Our Misinterpretation**:
- We thought "future texts" meant `is_forecasting_user==True` entries
- We thought we needed to filter out these entries

**Actual Meaning (Clarified)**:
- "Future texts" = Test set texts (not in training data)
- We should only use **training text data** for modeling
- `is_forecasting_user==True` simply means "users who need predictions"

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Our model already used only training text data
- ✅ Our predictions were already correct
- ✅ No regeneration needed

## 🎉 Next Steps

### Immediate: NONE (Everything Complete!)

Your submission is already done and confirmed correct. You can now:

1. **Wait for evaluation results**
   - Organizers will evaluate all submissions
   - Results will be posted on CodaBench
   - Expected timeline: After January 25 deadline

2. **Monitor CodaBench**
   - Check for any updates or announcements
   - View leaderboard when results are released

3. **Optional: Subtask 2b**
   - If you want to participate in Subtask 2b (disposition change forecasting)
   - Format: `pred_subtask2b.csv` with `user_id,pred_dispo_change_valence,pred_dispo_change_arousal`
   - Same 46 users, different target variable

---

## 📊 Expected Performance

Based on our validation results:

**Conservative Estimate**: CCC 0.65-0.68
**Expected**: CCC 0.68-0.70
**Optimistic**: CCC 0.70+

**Competitive Target**: Top 10-15%
- Our CCC 0.6833 is strong performance
- Ensemble approach should be robust
- Arousal-specialized model helps balance performance

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Ask organizers for clarification** when terminology is unclear
   - "Future text" meant test set texts, not temporal splits
   - `is_forecasting_user` is just a marker for which users need predictions

2. **Trust your original work** when it follows standard formats
   - Our 46-user predictions were correct from the start
   - Format validation caught no issues

3. **Document everything** for learning
   - Even incorrect analysis has value (archived for reference)
   - Shows problem-solving process
